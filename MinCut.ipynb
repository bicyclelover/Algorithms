    "## Min cut algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "The object of this assignment is to calculate the minimum number of cuts to create 2 distinct groups from a given graph. This is to be done using the random contraction algorithm. The random contraction algorithm works by randomly selecting an edge, and \"fusing\" the verticies that it connected. Fusing the verticies amounts to deleting one of them, while adding the edges that were connected to it to the remaining vertex. After fusing the verticies any self looping edges are deleted. When there are two remaining verticies the remaining edges define a cut.\n",
    "\n",
    "By randomly selecting edges to contract on there is only ~1/n^2 chance that a minimum cut is chosen, however since computers are great, you can run the algorithm multiple times to increase the liklihood of finding a minimum cut.\n"
